# ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º CommunityMate â€” Connecting New Citizens to Australian Democracy (Hackathon Demo)

CommunityMate is a Streamlit app prototype that helps new Australians:

- Discover and access **local government and community services**  
- Learn about **democracy and civics** (using Parliamentary Education Office (PEO) content)  
- Get **travel times, reminders, and demo bookings** for services  

ðŸ‘‰ This is a **hackathon demo**, so bookings, reminders, and form submissions are *simulated only* and stored locally in the `out/` folder.

## ðŸ“š Data

- **Service Data**: CSV files in `data/` with government & community services.  
- **Civics Knowledge Base**: Preâ€‘crawled PEO content stored at `data/peo/manifest.jsonl`.  

The repo already includes crawled data, so you can start the app right away.  

If you want to refresh or reâ€‘crawl civics resources:  
```bash
python datacrawler.py
```

This script:
- Crawls **Parliamentary Education Office (PEO)** civics content  
- Saves results into `data/peo/manifest.jsonl`  
- Used by the app to provide retrievalâ€‘augmented answers with citations.
